Use WP Terms Popup to ask visitors to agree to a terms of service, privacy policy or age verification request before they are allowed to view your site.

== Description ==

Use WP Terms Popup to ask visitors to agree to a terms of service, privacy policy or age verification request before they are allowed to view your site.

= How Does WP Terms Popup Work? =

Our plugin gives your users a simple three step process for gaining access to your website.

**Step #1: Your user must read the popup first.**

You decide what your popup shows to visitors: a terms of service, a privacy policy, age verification, etc.

**Step #2: The user agrees to your conditions.**

Each popup contains two buttons: one to show acceptance and another that redirects away from your site.

**Step #3: Website access is granted to your user.**

When the user accepts your conditions they are immediately taken to your site without any further interaction.

= Getting Started =

After installing and activating WP Terms Popup, go to "WP Terms Popup" in your WordPress admin menu and select "Add New" to create your first popup.

Go to "Settings" in the same "WP Terms Popup" menu to create the global settings that will apply to all popups. You can override these settings by editing each individual popup. 

From the "Settings" screen you can assign a popup to be shown sitewide or you can assign popups to individual pieces of content using the standard post editing screen.
