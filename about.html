RRSA is one of the leading Indian law offices operating as pioneers in the state of Bihar with associate offices having full service presence in prominent cities of India. </br></br>Mr. R.R. Sahaya, a fifth generation lawyer, is the Founder & Senior Managing Partner of R.R.Sahaya & Associates Law Offices. At a time when in unified Bihar, the conventional practice of law was mainly confined to the corridors of courts, Mr. Sahaya recognized that the economic reforms and liberalization boom would throw open several new opportunities within the Indian economy and this would in turn transform the landscape of Indian law practice. With the opening up of the Indian economy in early 1990's and recently in the state of Bihar, RRSA recognized that with a huge influx of Companies, Corporations, Banks and MNCs in India, providing top quality legal support was indeed the need of the hour. By setting up the non-contentious practice in addition to hardcore, active and trusted litigation practice of the chambers for centuries, he bridged the gap existing between the expectations & requirements of corporate clients and level of legal support then available within the state of Bihar. Mr. Sahaya ventured out to shape his pragmatic vision from unified Bihar and now, after an interesting and challenging journey of around three decades, he has an association of more than 100 Lawyers, Solicitors and paralegals spreading over the state of Bihar and at the associate offices with full service presence in Ahmedabad, Allahabad, Bangalore, Bhubaneswar, Bilaspur, Chandigarh, Chennai, Gangtok, Gauhati, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, New Delhi and Ranchi for providing highest quality contentious and non-contentious legal services/support to its clients spread in the different part of the globe.</br></br>RRSA has strong litigation arms in the state of Bihar. Our Offices directly attend to and represent in high stake litigations before the Patna High Court, District Civil Courts and all other Courts, Forums and Tribunals in the state of Bihar, Supreme Court of India and various High Courts throughout India. In today's scenario courts are flooded with multidisciplinary, technical and diversified nature of matters in which the practice of litigation can be both factually and procedurally complex and demands specialists who are experienced in the local laws, procedures & interpretation as well experts in court craft. All lawyers of the offices are meticulously trained to develop their skills in achieving all the above stated objectives and are connected through the latest technologies like Internet/Intranet, Facsimile, etc.</br></br>R.R.Sahaya & Associates, previously recognized as Sahay Law Chambers, was established in the year 1850 by its Founder Babu Munshi Heera Lal Saheb, Pleader, Legal Stalwart, Jurist and eminent lawyer of India, who was appointed as the Government Pleader by the British Crown in the year 1861, at the same time when the India High Courts Act was passed by the British Parliament in 1861 for the creation of High Courts in the three Presidencies instead of the Supreme Court and Sadar Adalats after the Mutiny of 1857 and the Company was dissolved and the Government of India was taken over by the Crown in 1858. It is one of the India's oldest law chambers, depicting an unparalleled history and legal tradition of being the legal advisor since the period of British East India Company and the successive government.</br></br>
The successors Mr. Raghubans Sahay and Mr. Jadunath Sahay were leading lawyers of the Bar of their time.

 </br></br>

Mr. Babu Narayan Sahay, in the third generation of the family of eminent lawyers was also a lawyer of great repute at a time when High Court was established in the State of Bihar and the judicial system in the state was in its nascent stage.

 </br></br>

Mr. Ratneshwar Nath Sahay (1907-88), fourth generation lawyer, carried on the diversified contentious practice of the chambers and its operation in the state of unified Bihar. R.N.Sahay was a doyen of the Bar, eminent Jurist & Educationist of unified Bihar whose reputation in civil & criminal trials is deservedly formidable. He was a renowned civil lawyer of repute with excellent court craft and advocacy who represented a sweep of high profile cases in the state and also before the Supreme Court of India. His distinguished merit had been duly testified by legends like Sir Courtney Terrell, the Chief Justice for Bihar & Orissa and Knighthood. Justice. Jwala Prasad, Rai Bahadur, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, the First President of India and many more in the early 1930s. His prominent personality was recognized all over the legal fraternity and apart from carrying out active practice, he also held other eminent positions in esteemed organizations including the dean of the faculty of law at the BU, Founder Principal of G.S. Law College, Chartered President Rotary etc. Many of the juniors from his chambers have become eminent Judges and served at other important positions in the field of law.
